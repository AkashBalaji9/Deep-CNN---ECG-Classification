1-D CNN model built in tensorflow and keras for 12-lead ECG classification problem. 
MIT-BIH dataset used for training the model
CNN Layer architecture is optimized using Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning subject to given constraints on filter size, no. of neurons per layer, etc.
Python code is ported into C language using tinymlgen library and final implementation was done in a microcontroller
